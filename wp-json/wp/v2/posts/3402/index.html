The site already contains a decent database so I figured it would be rather easy to measure which defaults to use.<\/p>\n<p>As an initial example, I would like to know how many seats were shared on each trip and therefore I did a simple query as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.theill.com\/stuff\/screenshots\/gomore-number-of-seats-per-ride-20110424-090916.png?w=660\" alt=\"Number of seats available for created rides on gomore.dk\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From this, it is pretty obvious that I should use &#8220;3&#8221; as a default number of seats available. In this case, some common sense would probably give you the same result (four seats in a standard car minus one for the driver).<\/p>\n<p>Same type of query can be used to figure out the most popular seat price:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.theill.com\/stuff\/screenshots\/gomore-default-price-per-seat-20110424-091149.png?w=660\" alt=\"Default price per seat for gomore.dk rides\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is even possible to <em>remove<\/em> options if you look into providing sensible defaults for your users. As in this case where the existing gomore.dk contains a checkbox for specifying if car is &#8220;smoking&#8221; or &#8220;non smoking&#8221; area. A query showed me<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.theill.com\/stuff\/screenshots\/gomore-smoking-20110424-091853.png?w=660\" alt=\"Smoking vs non smoking on gomore.dk\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>i.e. we really don&#8217;t need to have users decide on this .. more than 95% of all rides are non-smoking rides so the rest should either write it in a comment field or edit the ride afterwards to mark is specifically as &#8220;smoking&#8221;. So in this case we just removed an option from our wizard to avoid clutter. Lovely.<\/p>\n<p>The examples above should go for all defaults .. also stuff your marketing department would like to decide e.g. when a user creates an account and have to uncheck instead of check a &#8220;Subscribe to our daily, fancy, not-to-miss newsletter&#8221; box. Focus on pleasing your users by pre-selecting choices they probably <em>are<\/em> going to make themselves &#8230; follow the &#8220;don&#8217;t make me think&#8221; principle! It makes users happy and allow them to complete a task faster.<\/p>\n<p>Using sensible defaults goes for any type of application you are creating being for web, mobile or desktop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While working on migrating &#8220;gomore.dk&#8221;, a Danish ridesharing service, to Rails 3, I figured it would make sense to look into the existing database to figure out if I could add some sensible defaults when creating e.g. new rides.
