Today, Rails 2.3.2 was released so I decided to try if I could easily upgrade it and avoid using the Rails Engines plugin anymore. It was beautiful simple and took me less than ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>First, I had to update our Apache Passenger module with a version supporting Rails 2.3 so I did a<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ gem update passenger\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>and then run the install to build our apache module<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ passenger-install-apache2-module\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In my config\/environment.rb I changed<\/p>\n<pre><code>RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.2.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>to<\/p>\n<pre><code>RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.3.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>and asked Rails to update my various script files by issuing<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ rake rails:update\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Finally I remembered the application.rb should be named application_controller.rb now so I issued an explicit task for this as well<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ rake rails:update:application_controller\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In the Rails Engines plugin you need to have the \u201croutes.rb\u201d file in the root of your plugin but with Rails 2.3.2 you should have it in the \u2018config\u2019 folder under your plugin and its content should be wrapped in \u201cActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|\u201d as the root routes.rb. So I changed this from<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/vendor\/plugins\/life_intake\/routes.rb\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>to<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/vendor\/plugins\/life_intake\/config\/routes.rb\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The contents of this routes.rb was changed from<\/p>\n<pre><code>map.resources :foods\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>to<\/p>\n<pre><code>ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|\n  map.resources :foods\nend\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Finally I had to update the root \u201croutes.rb\u201d to avoid using the \u201cfrom_plugin\u201d call e.g. I simply removed lines such as<\/p>\n<pre><code>map.from_plugin :life_intake\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now I don\u2019t need the Rails Engines plugin anymore so I removed it with<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ .\/script\/plugin remove engines\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That\u2019s it .. I was now able to run my tests and start up my project and have it run on Rails 2.3.2.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My lifestyleapps project (still in very early beta) was running Rails 2.2.2 with the Rails Engines plugin ten minutes ago.
