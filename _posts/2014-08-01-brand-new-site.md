Having run the same design on theill.com since 1998 I decided it was time to scrap it and move on to a new one. Since I don't like lots of complex design I designed on using Jekyll and found a nice Hyde theme I could use as a starting point.

### No more ASP

Previously I ran ASP (and we're talking classic ASP here) on theill.com but that's not anymore. As a consequence all my ASP projects will not have a working demo on this site.
